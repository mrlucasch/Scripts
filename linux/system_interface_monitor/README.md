# System Network Interface Monitor

This is a script to monitor the amount of data being sent out of each network interface. It shows both a total value as well as the value since you started. It also shows a live graph of the values since you started

# Run it
```
python interface_monitor.py eth0 eth2 eth3 eth4 ...
```

*Really only supports 4-6 interfaces well. Mostly tested on 4 interfaces.
